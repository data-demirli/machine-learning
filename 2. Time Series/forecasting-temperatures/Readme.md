# Forecasting Temperatures
* Predicting the next day's temperature

## Summary:
**Dataset:** Daily temperature values and calendar dates over a ten year period  
**Model:** Recurrent Neural Network which outputs the temperature value for the following day  
**Particulars:** Time series cross-validation splits, sliding window with time lags, neural network with recurrent nodes (LSTM and GRU)
